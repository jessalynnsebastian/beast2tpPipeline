Description: Given fasta files and corresponding metadata, this package 
    goes through the process of splitting fasta files into SNP clusters, 
    creating an XML file for BEAST2 (constrained to a particular model - 
    use BEAUti otherwise), running BEAST2, running TransPhylo, and then 
    doing some kind of regression with the TransPhylo results. This package 
    was developed with the specific application of the Kopanyo project with 
    TB data, so some of it is highly specific and not very transferable.
