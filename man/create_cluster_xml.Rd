\arguments{
\item{path_to_template}{The path to the template XML file.}

\item{seqs}{A matrix of DNA sequences (or SNPs), where rownames correspond
to sample IDs, or an \code{ape::DNAbin} object.}

\item{cluster_name}{The name of the cluster.}

\item{sampling_dates}{A named vector of sampling dates, where
the names are the corresponding sample IDs. Dates should be in
either decimal years or in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".}

\item{mcmc_iterations}{The number of MCMC iterations to run.}

\item{store_every}{The frequency of storing trees.}

\item{min_clockrate}{The minimum clock rate for the uniform clock
rate prior. Defaults to tuberculosis genome clock rate. DO NOT adjust
for SNPs here.}

\item{max_clockrate}{The maximum clock rate for the uniform clock
rate prior. Defaults to tuberculosis genome clock rate.}

\item{init_clockrate}{The initial clock rate for the clock rate.}

\item{whole_genome_length}{The length of the whole genome. Used
to adjust the clock rate for SNPs. Defaults to TB length.}

\item{out_dir}{The directory to write the output XML file. Files
are automatically named after their FASTA names.}

\description{
Use a template XML file to create new XML files for BEAST2 input.
This function can replace sequences, sampling dates, mcmc iterations,
frequency of storing trees, and, for a uniform clock rate, the minimum
and maximum clock rates.

This was designed just to be used with the provided template file, though
it could theoretically be used with others. The template file was written
for tuberculosis data. It contains an adjustment for ascertainment bias due
to the SNPs, a Gamma site model, and HKY substitution model, strict clock,
Coalescent constant population model, uniform clock rate prior (min/max editable),
and lognormal(1, 1.25) freqParameter, kappa, and popsize priors.

The template xml contains placeholders:
\itemize{
\item SNP_FILE_NAME_HERE for the name of the SNP file
\item ALIGNMENT_INFORMATION_HERE for the sequence information
\item DATE_INFORMATION_HERE for the sampling dates
\item CLOCKRATE_MINIMUM_HERE for the minimum uniform clock rate
\item CLOCKRATE_MAXIMUM_HERE for the maximum uniform clock rate
\item CLOCKRATE_INITIAL_HERE for the initial clock rate
\item MCMC_ITERATIONS_HERE for the number of MCMC iterations
\item STORE_EVERY_HERE for the frequency of storing trees
}
}
